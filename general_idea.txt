Idea for file sync tool

compare file systems of two disks and generate a report

create tree of all files in directories

Two properties: path and content-approximate (size, date modified, first 8 bytes)

Report is three different files

File 1: disk differences (same path, different content OR different path, same content)
	Indicate which is newer
File 2: Files on one disk that aren't on the other
File 3: Duplicate files (same file at multiple places in one disk)
